**Laundry App UI Design (Greyscale Prototype)
Overview**

This project is a greyscale user interface (UI) prototype designed in Figma for a laundry management mobile app.
The goal was to craft a clean, distraction-free experience that highlights usability and functional flow before applying visual branding.

**Design Objective**

Create a minimal yet intuitive interface covering the end-to-end customer journey:

User onboarding & login

Service selection (wash, dry-clean, pickup)

Order tracking

Payment & summary screens

Each screen focuses on hierarchy, readability, and touch interaction flow.

**Core Design Principles**

Greyscale Wireframe	:- Pure structural design with no color distractions to validate layout first.
Consistency	Unified spacing, typography, and iconography.
Accessibility	High-contrast greyscale ensures clear visual hierarchy.
User-Centric Flow	Streamlined booking flow with minimal taps from start to confirmation.

**Screens Included**

Login / Sign-Up	Entry point for users to authenticate or create accounts.
Dashboard	Displays current and past orders with call-to-action shortcuts.
Booking Flow	Enables service type selection, address input, and scheduling.
Payment Screen	Provides summary view and payment confirmation UX.

**Tools & Methodology**

Figma â€“ for design and prototyping

Wireframing-first approach â€“ validated navigation before colors

Mobile-first layout â€“ optimized for 360â€“400px viewport width

**Outcome**

The design demonstrates:

How minimalist design can maintain function-first clarity.

The importance of wireframes before visual branding.

A scalable structure ready for developer handoff and color iteration.
